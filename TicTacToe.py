'''
--------------
Specifications
--------------
-Task (T): Playing  Tic-Tac-Toe
-Perfromance(P): % of games won in Tournament
-Experience: Data from games played against self (Indirect feedback)
-Learning: It boils down to optimizing the function (Target function) that finds best Move 
	for a board State from a set of legal Moves.

---------------------------------
Design choices for Implementation
---------------------------------
-In the case of this game we learn an approximation of the ideal target function described above.
-Approximate Target Function (V): Maps board -> R
-Approximate Target Function Representation: w0+w1(x1)+w2(x2)+..... ws (weights) & xs (board features)
